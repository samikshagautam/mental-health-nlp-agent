# mental-health-nlp-agent
I'm learning NLP by building something meaningful — an AI agent that reads how you're feeling and tries to understand your emotions.
How it works
You type something like "I feel so anxious and scared about everything" and the agent:

Cleans up the messy text
Checks if it's positive, negative, or neutral
Looks for specific emotions (anxiety, depression, anger, hope)
Decides how serious it is
Responds based on what it finds

Built with
Python, NLTK, TextBlob, Pandas, Matplotlib, WordCloud
What's next
Building a full-stack app around this — Flask backend, React frontend, database, and eventually Nepali language support.
Status
Week 1 done. Learning and building every day.
